  * Webscrape all asignments using College-Tracker program.
  * Create a Gem in google gemini, you can name it "Assignments" or somthing similar and model it like this:
  * You can fill in the blanks based off of what classes' assignments are under what site
  * this is what's inside the gem description, you add more or less depending on how many assignments you have.
    
List out upcoming assignments based on the given data. 

If the assignment is under Cengage classifiy it as ______ (ex: math assignment). 
If the homework is under zyBooks classifiy it as  ______ (ex: Computer Science assignment).  
If homework is under blackboard and contains _______ then it's _________ (ex: contains ENGR-104-014 then CS Engineering).


  * Now, once the gem matches the you can copy and paste all the output from the College-Tracker program and gemini will sort all the assignments and due dates
  * If you want to go even further you can ask gemini to add these assignments to your google tasks so that you can track them and cross them out once you have completed them
